	   <p> <b>Bora Bora </b> is a 30.55 km2 (12 sq mi) island group in the Leeward group in the western part of the Society Islands of <i>French Polynesia</i>, an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in the Pacific Ocean. </p>
       <p> Bora Bora is a major international tourist destination, famous for its aqua-centric luxury resorts. The major settlement, Vaitape, is on the western side of the main island, opposite the main channel into the lagoon. Produce of the island is mostly limited to what can be obtained from the sea and the plentiful coconut trees, which were historically of economic importance for copra.</p>  
       <p> The island was inhabited by Polynesian settlers around the 4th century. The first European sighting was made by Jakob Roggeveen in 1722.

James Cook sighted the island on 29 July 1769, using a Tahitian navigator, Tupaia. The London Missionary Society arrived in 1820 and founded a Protestant church in 1890. Bora Bora was an independent kingdom until 1888 when its last queen Teriimaevarua III was forced to abdicate by the French who annexed the island as a colony. </p>

       <h2> Tourism </h2>

       <p> 	The island's economy is driven almost solely by tourism. Several resorts have been built on the motu (small islands, from Tahitian) surrounding the lagoon. Hotel Bora Bora opened in 1961, and nine years later built the first over-the-water bungalows on stilts over the lagoon. Today, over-water bungalows are a standard feature of most Bora Bora resorts. The quality of those bungalows ranges from comparably cheap, basic accommodations to very luxurious and expensive.</p>

	   <p><b>Romance.</b> The island of Bora Bora rises from the velvet blues of the deep water up through the softer hues of the lagoon and into the air that surrounds the island. Its touch of the sea breeze tingles the skin. Its power fills each beat of the heart. Bora Bora is located a brief 50-minute flight from <i>The Islands of Tahiti </i>or Moorea. Bora Bora, with a lagoon of turquoise waters resembling an artistâ€™s palette of bright blues and greens, will make you feel love at first sight.  Romantics from around the world appreciate Bora Bora, where the lush tropical slopes and valleys of <i>Mount Otemanu</i> blossom with hibiscus, while palm-covered <i>motu</i> circle the illuminated lagoon like a delicate pearl necklace from the islands of French Polynesia.</p>
